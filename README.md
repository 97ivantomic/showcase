# Showcase

Due to a lack of an actual open-source project to share, I've made this
repo public to serve as an example of my **coding style** and maybe some
analytical skills or technical knowledge — or lack thereof — but mostly style.

For example, I tend to favor readability over everything else
and like making unit tests go from red to green.

## Some highlights:

- mockist vs. classicist TDD in [`4_7.test.ts`](./4_trees_graphs/4_7.test.ts#L164)
