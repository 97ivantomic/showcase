# Showcase

Due to a lack of an actual open-source project to share, I've made this
repo public to serve as an example of my **coding style** and possibly as an example of
analytical skills and technical knowledge â€” or lack thereof.

I tend to favor readability over everything else.

## Some highlights:

- mockist vs. classicist TDD in [`4_7.test.ts`](./4_trees_graphs/4_7.test.ts#L164)
